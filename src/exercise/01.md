# Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/01.md`

### 1) Attribute vs Properties

Attributes are the one we give in html elements. For example: id, class, custom
attributes (non standard html attributes)

Dom converts standard attributes into javascript object and attach it to element
object. For instance, if the tag is `<body id="page">`, then the DOM object has
`body.id="page"`.

If an attribute is non-standard, there won’t be a DOM-property for it. All
attributes are accessible by using the following methods:

- elem.hasAttribute(name) – checks for existence.
- elem.getAttribute(name) – gets the value.
- elem.setAttribute(name, value) – sets the value.
- elem.removeAttribute(name) – removes the attribute.

### 2) innerText vs textContent

`Prefer using textContent over innerText`

innerText - ignores styles and hidden content

textContent - displays hidden content and styles also.

## Background

It doesn't take long to learn how to make "Hello World" appear on the page with
HTML:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div>Hello World</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The browser takes this HTML code and generates
[the DOM (the Document Object Model)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
out of it. The browser then exposes the DOM to JavaScript so you can interact
with it to add a layer of interactivity to your web-page.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div>Hello World</div>
    <script type="module">
      // your JavaScript here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Years ago, people were generating HTML on the server and then adding JavaScript
on top of that generated HTML for interactivity. However, as requirements for
that interactivity became more challenging, this approach produced applications
that were difficult to maintain and had performance issues.

So modern JavaScript frameworks were created to address some of the challenges
by programmatically creating the DOM rather than defining it in hand-written
HTML.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/01.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/01.html)

It's important to have a basic understanding of how to generate and interact
with DOM nodes using JavaScript because it will help you understand how React
works under the hood a little better. So in this exercise we're actually not
going to use React at all. Instead we're going to use JavaScript to create a
`div` DOM node with the text "Hello World" and insert that DOM node into the
document.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 generate the root node

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/01.extra-1.html)

Rather than having the `root` node in the HTML, see if you can create that one
using JavaScript as well.
